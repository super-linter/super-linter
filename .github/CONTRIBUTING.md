# Contributing

:wave: Hi there!

We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project.
Your help is essential for keeping it great.

## Submitting a pull request

We use [pull requests](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter/pulls) to
contribute new features, fixes, or documentation.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull
request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you
  would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, submit them as
  separate pull requests.
- Write [descriptive commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Draft pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is
something blocking you.
