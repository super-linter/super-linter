skip-framework:
  # The Kubernetes framework because it doesn't run Kustomize before running the
  # scan, as expected. There's the Kustomize framework for that.
  # If we don't skip the Kubernetes framework, Checkov reports issues against
  # Kubernetes descriptors that we handle with Kustomize. For example, we set
  # a non-default Kubernetes Namespace using Kustomize.
  # Checkov doesn't currently support skipping checks only for a given set of
  # frameworks, and the Kubernetes framework runs the same checks that the Helm
  # and the Kustomize frameworks run. So, we skip the Kubernetes framework when
  # running test cases. In case we need to implement new Kubernetes test cases,
  # we have to do that as part of the test Helm chart or the test Kustomize
  # "package".
