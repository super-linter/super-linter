## This /.sqlfluff file can be used to configure the SQLFluff linter when
## used via the Super Linter. Copy it to the .github/linters folder of
## your repo, and uncomment the necessary lines to configure the Super Linter.
##
## IMPORTANT NOTE: The Super Linter configuration file for SQLFluff
## supersedes any local configuration files you might have in within your
## codebase. For this reason it should only be used when you want the same
## configuration for your entire code base. If you need different configuration
## in different folders you must leave this config commented out, and instead
## manage all your config files within your code base rather than in the
## .github/linters folder
##
## Configuration options are described here:
## https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/configuration.html
